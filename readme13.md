# Typescript examination thirteenth session

This code is a simple web page that includes a form and various buttons.

First, the necessary CSS and JavaScript files for the page are imported. Then, in the body section of the page, a title with the text "Number" is displayed, which is designed using a gradient color effect.

Next, a form with a text input and various buttons is displayed. The text input is used to enter a random number, and the "Submit" button is used to submit the form, while the "Show a random number" button is used to display a random number in the input field in a case user dont want to enter a random number by itself.

Additionally, two other buttons exist in the form. The "Show Array" button is used to display an array of random numbers in the console part of website, and the "Clear" button is used to clear the form and array content.

Finally, the JavaScript file is executed, which includes the necessary code to control the behavior of the page.

The JavaScript code in this web page handles the functionality of the buttons and form validation. 

First, it defines an event listener for the "Show a random number" button. When this button is clicked, the event listener generates a five-digit random number.

Then, it defines an event listener for the "Submit" button. When this button is clicked, the event listener checks if the input field is empty or does not contain a five-digit number. If either of these conditions is true, an alert is displayed to notify the user.

After that, it defines an event listener for the "Show Array" button. When this button is clicked, the event listener generates an array of prime numbers up to the entered number. This array is then logged to the console.

Finally, it defines an event listener for the "Clear" button. When this button is clicked, the event listener clears the value of the text input field and empties the array of prime numbers.

In summary, the JavaScript code handles generating random numbers, validating input fields, generating arrays of prime numbers, and handling button clicks in order to provide functionality to the web page.
